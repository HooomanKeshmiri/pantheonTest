pantheonTest:
This is a basic Drupal website that was developed through Pantheon and Lando. The goal of this project was to get familiar with both making content directly with Drupal as well as using Lando to initialize the website.
###########

Description:
This application is website that can be navigated by anyone made in Drupal. It can be used by anyone to get familiar with both using Drupal. It is recommended that if you are to download the files and launch the website that you use Lando to both initialize and launch the site. The Lando installation guide will be posted further below. To develop the web page Drupal was used as this is a predecessor to a project that I will be on using Drupal and I needed to learn how to use Drupal effectively. Issues arose when attempting to use a drupal8 recipe directly from lando as opposed to pantheon, and editing files would not fix the issue that arose and I plan to solve this issue in the future.

Installation:

Downloading Lando: https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html

To use this web page first download the code base from github. Following that install Lando on your device and type "Lando init" in the repository that you cloned.  Choose pantheon as the recipe. Following that type "Lando start". After that finishes, you can type "open" and the URL that lando gives you and you are all set!

Usage:
The usage of this web page is extremely simple and like every other webpage. If you would like to edit the page you can visit the developmental tools in the Drupal GUI.
